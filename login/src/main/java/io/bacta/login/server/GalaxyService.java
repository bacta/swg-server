/**
 * Curates a list of galaxies that this LoginServer can service.
 * <p>
 * By default, the login server will only service galaxies that have been registered in its database. This establishes
 * a trust relationship between the login server and the galaxy server. Without this trust relationship, it would be
 * impossible to verify that a galaxy server belongs to the galaxy cluster.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Galaxy Registration</h2>
 * <p>
 * Galaxy Registration is the process of a galaxy server establishing a trust relationship with the login server. When
 * a galaxy server comes online, it is expected to announce its online state to the login server. This is how the login
 * server knows to offer connections to that specific galaxy server. In response to a galaxy server announcing itself
 * to the login server, the login server will send a response with the galaxy server's unique identifier in the login
 * server's galaxy cluster. If the galaxy server is not recognized, or untrusted, then the login server will ignore the
 * request from the galaxy server.
 * <p>
 * In order for a galaxy to be recognized, or trusted, it must first be entered into the login server's galaxy cluster
 * database. Required information must be present for a galaxy server to be trusted. First, a unique, immutable id must
 * exist for the galaxy server. Additionally, the name, address, and port are required. Other information may be set by
 * the galaxy server when it successfully identifies with the login server by announcing its online status.
 * <p>
 * Although there have been discussions about requiring a cryptographic key to be involved in the identification process,
 * currently there are no plans to implement this added security measure. Therefore, it is advisable that galaxy servers
 * are located on the same network as the login server. If a galaxy server that you want included in your login server
 * exists outside of the network of the login server, you should seek to create a VPN between the login server and the
 * galaxy server so that the network may be trusted. This recommendation can help safeguard against attempts to hijack
 * a galaxy server by assuming its identity with address and port spoofing.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Automatic Galaxy Registration</h2>
 * <p>
 * A configuration setting exists that enables automatic galaxy registration. This means that when a galaxy announces
 * itself for the first time, the login server will automatically add it to the galaxy cluster database, assigning it
 * a unique identifier and recording its name, address, and port.
 * <p>
 * <b>This mechanism is meant for local development servers only because it allows any galaxy server to register itself
 * without approval.</b> It is highly advisable to disable this setting in a production environment or run the risk of
 * untrusted galaxies registering with your galaxy cluster. If you are running a local LAN server with no external port
 * mapping rules to your login server, then you can safely leave this option enabled.
